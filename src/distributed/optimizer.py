def DistributedOptimizer(optimizer, named_parameters=None,

    """
    An optimizer that wraps another torch.optim.Optimizer, using an allreduce to
    average gradient values before applying gradients to model weights.
    Allreduce operations are executed after each gradient is computed by `loss.backward()`
    in parallel with each other. The `step()` method ensures that all allreduce operations are
    finished before applying gradients to the model.
    DistributedOptimizer exposes the `synchronize()` method, which forces allreduce operations
    to finish before continuing the execution. It's useful in conjunction with gradient
    clipping, or other operations that modify gradients in place before `step()` is executed.
    Example of gradient clipping:
    ```
    output = model(data)
    loss = F.nll_loss(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.synchronize()
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm(model.parameters(), args.clip)
    optimizer.step()
    ```
    Arguments:
        optimizer: Optimizer to use for computing gradients and applying updates.
        named_parameters: A mapping between parameter names and values. Used for naming of
                          allreduce operations. Typically just `model.named_parameters()`.
        compression: Compression algorithm used during allreduce to reduce the amount
                     of data sent during the each parameter update step.  Defaults to
                     not using compression.
    """
    # We dynamically create a new class that inherits from the optimizer that was passed in.
    # The goal is to override the `step()` method with an allreduce implementation.
    cls = type(optimizer.__class__.__name__, (optimizer.__class__,),
               dict(_DistributedOptimizer.__dict__))
    return cls(optimizer.param_groups, named_parameters,
